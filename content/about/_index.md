I am a master's student in Northwestern University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and specialzing in robotics and control. At present, I am doing some fascinating projects in CRB lab at Northwestern University.

I come from HangShi City in China and have studyed in the United States for around 3 years. I used to live in Florida in first two years and right now I am living in Illinois. These oversea study experience gave me the opportunity to know various of people from different background.
