At the intersection of digital marketing (inbound marketing, sales funnels, customer satisfaction) and web development (full stack and usability), I build the stage for you to shine. My focus is increasingly on web development.

With a home base in Hamburg, Germany 🍔🇩🇪, I work remotely. Often in New York 🗽 and diverse new locations 🌎. Knowing cultural context and languages (fluent in 🇬🇧🇩🇪🇪🇸🇧🇷 with more in the making) supports your global reach.

As a logistics professional by trade, being organized, timely and practical is second nature to me. INFJ-A type.

Work ethic, skills and knowledge matter, but so does the whole person. I move with boxing, yoga, hiking and climbing. I am moved by profound conversations, muralism art, magical realism literature, alternative rock music, and rom-com, bio pics, as well as plot twist movies.
