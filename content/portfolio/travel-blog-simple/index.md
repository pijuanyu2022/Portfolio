The first project of my Full Stack Web Development Program at Hamburg Coding School was a travel blog using JavaScript, Google Maps and Firebase.

The homepage is a map with markers on the geographic locations of places I have visted. At clicking a marker, a card with an image and a short description appears. The data on the cards is loaded from Firebase Database, while the images are stored locally. A login page performed through Firebase Authentication allows a user to see the collection of all blog posts, edit, and add new posts. A contact page rounds the project off.

The layout was done with HTML, CSS and Tailwindcss. All images are mine and not edited. The style is reminiscent of a tropical beach which I found fitting for a travel blog. The background is clear turquoise water. Image cards and text boxes are on yellow background like the sand, a sand image could be a neat detail. Headlines have a hand-writing appeal through RockSalt-Regular font.
