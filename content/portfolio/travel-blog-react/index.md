The final project of the Full Stack Web Development Program at Hamburg Coding School was also a travel blog but in React. I scored 15/15 points.

I could have built up on the previous blog, but decided to work from scratch. Only images and places made it from the first travel blog to the second. 

The homepage is devided into a map with markers on one side and a collection of all preview cards of places I have visted on the other. The order is newest to oldest. Again at clicking a marker on the map, a note with an image and a short description appears. Both preview cards from the collection and notes from the map reroute to a detailed blog post with text on the left and map on the right. The data is loaded from Firebase Database and the images stored locally. A login pop-up through Firebase Authentication allows a user to edit and add posts, as well as configure their profile with name and image. A contact page rounds the project off.

The layout was done with HTML, CSS and Tailwindcss. Font Awesome was used for Icons. All images are mine and not edited. The style inspiration is 80s scrapbook. The base colors are white and gray with accentuation in pink and turquoise. Image cards are resembling polaroid pictures. Thumbtacks and sticky notes are used on the map. The post editor background is a yellow legal pad. H1 Headlines have an label maker appeal through Impact_Label font. H2 headlines with the permanent marker font PermanentMarker-Regular are used for dates and authors. The 401 page comes with a RickRoll.
