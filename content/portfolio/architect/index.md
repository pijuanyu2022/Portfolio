For a medium-sized interior architecture office specialized in corporate office spaces, I conceptionalized and realized their website relaunch.

The website is made and runs on a site builder, thus is fully responsive. While resorting to the conventient drag and drop building block functionality of the builder, I still used a great deal of JavaScript code injections and custom CSS styling.

Several features were incorporated at the customer's request. The navigation shows font awesome sourced icons on hover and active. The main page showcases a responsive custom made html model with icons. Descriptions appear on hover. Image cards on the project and team pages have their respective but different hover effects.

Besides design, this project included seo wording while conforming to the client's input. The images were provided by the client, but run trough an image optimizer. All logos and the custom icons on the front page also came from the client.
